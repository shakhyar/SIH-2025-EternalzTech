## Overview
Geometric Spoke Pull (GSP) is a geometry-driven forecasting model designed for ultra-low-power embedded systems.  
It avoids neural networks and runs entirely using fixed-point arithmetic.

## Key Features
- Runs on Arduino Nano (2KB SRAM)
- No neural networks
- Integer-only inference
- Robust under sensor noise
